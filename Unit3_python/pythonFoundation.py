# data types = basic building bllock of python programming.
# string = data represented as characters wrapped
# together in quotation marks.
# integer = whole numbers.
678
# floats = decimal numbers 
678.99
# boolean = true or false values
True
False
# variables = containers for data
# we create variables using the following steps:
# 1. create a variable name
# 2. apply an equal sign
# 3. give it a data type value
userName = "Jalen. "
message ='Good Morning, '
weather ='It is 60 degress and sunny.'

# we use print to see our data in our terminal
print(message + userName + weather)
number1= 1200
number2= 800
print(number1, number2)
name= 'My name is Jalen.'
activity= 'I am going to an arcade.'
time='I will do this at 2:00pm.'
print(name, activity, time)

# Python Operators

# arithmmatic 
# addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

# assignment
# giving things values/ assigning values

# Comparison
# Are these the same or are these different

# Logical 
# 2 factor comparison

# A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore.
# A variable name should be short, simple, yet descriptive.


# Cases

# camel case 
# every word starts with a captital letter except the first letter

x = 20 # we are assigning the value of 20 to the variable x
x = x+3

# single equal sign (=) the equal sign in python has nothing to do with 
# we are assigning a variable instead of getting a result.
# double equal sign(==) is used for comparisons
