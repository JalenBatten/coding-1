# What is a function? 
# A set of instructions that perform a specific task or job.

# there are two variants of functions in python
# Built-in functions- instructions that are pre-written in the python programming language.
#example
# print() is a built-in function. When we pass data it will output 
# it into the terminal automatically
print("Coding Class")

# input() is a built-in function. It allows us to write and pass 
# in data into our program from the terminal.
name = input("What is your name?")
print(name)

number= int ( input("please provide a number"))
print(23*number)

# User Defined Functions- custom functions written by engineers.

# Function Syntax- how it is written.

def sandwichInstructions():
    print('get 2 pieces of bried')
    print('putting ingredients inside of bread')
    print('step 3. put bread with ingredients together.')

# The "def" keyword is used to tell the computer we are creating a function.

# there are two states of a user defined function;
        # the function definition
        # the function call

# this is a function call
